                                    "clustering"
                                    - meaning
                                    the system found other people with similar interests (each of you liked pictures of
                                    dogs)
                                    and suggested
                                    things that the systemre specific to those people that you had not yet liked (two

                                    dogs also liked cats, so the system thought you might be interested in cats).

                                <p>We use clustering to figure out which groups you might be interested in by
                                    determining
                                    which
                                    groups your
                                    friends are in. The more friends you have in a group, the more likely we are to
                                    recommend it
                                    to you.
                                    When you have an equal number of friends in two groups, we use other factors such as
                                    location, interests
                                    of the group compared to your interests, etc.</p>

                                <p>We noticed that you spend a lot of time looking at pictures your friend Bob posts but
                                    not
                                    so
                                    much time
                                    looking at pictures Susan posts. The one difference is Susan's pictures of rabbits,
                                    which
                                    you look at
                                    longer than any of Bob's pictures. We figured that out using anomaly detection. Now
                                    we
                                    know
                                    to show you
                                    Susan's rabbits, then all of Bob's posts, then Susan's other posts.</p>

                                    updating what
